# Android Security Analysis

## Overview
This project explores Android's security architecture through the development and analysis of custom malware and real world spyware simulation techniques. The aim was to show how android's security responds to these threats and show the strength of Android Security.

## Objectives
- Analyze Android's security mechanisms using a hands-on approach
- Create custom malware using Java (single and multi-activity).
- Simulate real-world spyware behaviour such as
  - Unauthorized Camera Access
  - App usage tracking
  - Icon hiding
- Use AhMyth Remote Access Trojan (RAT) to evaluate Android's defenses against remote attacks

## Tools and Techniques
- Java
- Android Studio
- AhMyth RAT
- Android Emulator
- APKTool
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

## What's Included
- Project Report
- Presentation Slides
- Code Snippets

> **Note**: No actual malware or compiled APKs are included in this repository

## Test Environment
All simulations and malware deployments were conducted in a controlled, isolated environment. No real devices were infected.
